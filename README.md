Harvardx CS50x 11/2020 Final Project - Games Track game titled, Bocks,
written in Lua, and utilizing the LÃ–VE2D framework.

Bocks is a re-imagining of Rock, paper, scissors, where
you control the pink shape, and try to avoid shapes that can
defeat you, while trying to capture shapes that you can defeat.

Arrow keys control movement, while the 'SPACE' key changes your
shape.
